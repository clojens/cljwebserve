* Wicked Simple Webserver
  cljwebserve is a simple concurrent webserver that I wrote to host my
  site.  It doesn't conform to any standards because I've never read
  any of them on purpose.  Have at it.

** Usage
   + Spin up a simple server to spit out files on port 3000:
     + (run-server 3000 handle-files)

   + Spin up another server which parses the url into clojure:
     + (run server 3001 handle-clojure)

   + Get some data regarding the first server:
     + (:3000 @servers)

   + Kill the servers:
     + (stop-server 3000)
     + (stop-server 3001)

** Clojure Parser
   Parses a request of as follows:
   www.someplace.com/_-/+/3/4/5/-_ -> (+ 3 4 5)

   Then, it evals the parsed request.  

   This is incredibly safe and not at all a terrible idea. Regardless,
   you probably don't want to open these ports to the world.
